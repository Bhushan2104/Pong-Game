# Pong Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Pong Game**! This is a Python-based recreation of the classic Pong arcade game. It's built using the `turtle` graphics module, making it simple yet fun to play and explore.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of my journey through the **100 Days of Python Code** challenge. The game demonstrates the use of Python Turtle Graphics, object-oriented programming (OOP), and event handling.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the keyboard controls to move the paddles up and down:
   - Player 1: `W` (up), `S` (down)
   - Player 2: `Up Arrow` (up), `Down Arrow` (down)
2. Prevent the ball from crossing your side!
3. First player to score [Insert your scoring system, e.g., "5 points"] wins the game.

## ✨ Features

- **Turtle Graphics**: Simple visuals created using Python's built-in `turtle` module.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control paddles with keyboard keys.
- **Collision Detection**: Ball bounces off walls and paddles with realistic physics.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays scores for both players.
- **Modular Design**: Clean, object-oriented code for better readability and scalability.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. This game was developed with Python 3.x.  
Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install turtle
```

(Usually, `turtle` comes pre-installed with Python.)

## 🛠️ How to Run the Game

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhushan2104/pong-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pong-game
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python pong.py
   ```

Enjoy the game! 🎉

## 📖 What I Learned

- Advanced usage of the Turtle Graphics module.
- Implementing object-oriented programming in Python.
- Handling user input with event listeners.
- Designing game logic and maintaining game state.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This project was guided by the **100 Days of Python Code** course. Special thanks to the course creators and the Python community for resources and inspiration.
